## üîç Project Steps
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.  
   - Checked for missing values, data types, and duplicates.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handled missing data and outliers.  
   - Converted data types and standardized column names.  
   - Exported cleaned data to MySQL for further analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used statistical summaries and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.  
   - Plotted relationships between key metrics using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

4. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Wrote SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and group data.  
   - Performed joins, calculated KPIs, and validated data integrity in MySQL.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.  
   - Created visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and KPIs.  
   - Designed an interactive dashboard showing overall insights and trends.

6. **Report Creation**  
   - Summarized findings and insights in a clean report.  
   - Highlighted actionable recommendations.

7. **Presentation (Gamma)**  
   - Built a professional interactive presentation summarizing the entire workflow and results.
